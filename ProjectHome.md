This is a prolog project whose objectives are:
  * Learn more about SWI-Prolog developing for medium to big projects
  * Develop an AI for solving the finding number game.
  * Experiment with prolog libraries and tools.

The game is usually played between 2, each with a secret number (usually 4 digits, no repeated digits allowed). In turns one tries to guess the number, and the oponent says how many digits well placed and how many wrong placed the guessing has.
